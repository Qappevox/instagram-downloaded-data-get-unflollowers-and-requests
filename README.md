# instagram-downloaded-data-get-unflollowers-and-requests
This script helps you check who unfollowed you on Instagram by comparing your followers list with your following list. It also allows you to get a list of the people who have sent you follow requests.

# Requirements
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>Instagram data in JSON format</li>

# Usage
<li>Request your Instagram data from the app</li>
<li>Extract the zip file and locate the "followers_1.json", "following.json", and "follow_requests_you've_received.json" files.</li>
<li>Place these files in the same directory as the script.</li>
<li>Run the script.</li>

# Output
The script will create two files:

<li>"unfollowers.txt": A list of the people who have unfollowed you on Instagram.</li>
<li>"requests.txt": A list of the people who have sent you follow requests.</li>
Note: If there are no unfollowers or follow requests, the files will be created but will be empty.

# Important
<li> Make sure the files are named correctly and are in the correct format (JSON).</li>
<li> Make sure the script is in the same directory as the JSON files.</li>
<li> The script is case-sensitive, so make sure the file names match exactly.</li>
